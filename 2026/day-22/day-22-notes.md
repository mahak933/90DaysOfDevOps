## Challenge Tasks
------

- Task 1: Install and Configure Git

1.Verify Git is installed on your machine
2.Set up your Git identity — name and email
3.Verify your configuration


-------

- Task 2: Create Your Git Project
  
1.Create a new folder called devops-git-practice
2.Initialize it as a Git repository
3.Check the status — read and understand what Git is telling you
4.Explore the hidden .git/ directory — look at what's inside

------

- Task 3: Create Your Git Commands Reference
  
1.Create a file called git-commands.md inside the repo
2.Add the Git commands you've used so far, organized by category:
3.Setup & Config
4.Basic Workflow
5.Viewing Changes
6.For each command, write:
7.What it does (1 line)
8.An example of how to use it

-------

- Task 4: Stage and Commit
  
1.Stage your file
2.Check what's staged
3.Commit with a meaningful message
4.View your commit history

--------

- Task 5: Make More Changes and Build History
  
1.Edit git-commands.md — add more commands as you discover them
2.Check what changed since your last commit
3.Stage and commit again with a different, descriptive message
4.Repeat this process at least 3 times so you have multiple commits in your history
5.View the full history in a compact format

---------

- Task 6: Understand the Git Workflow

1.What is the difference between git add and git commit?

`git add` - Moves changes to staging area and used to mark files to include in commit

`git commit` - Saves staged changes to project history and used to save changes permanently

2.What does the staging area do? Why doesn't Git just commit directly?

3.What information does git log show you?

4.What is the .git/ folder and what happens if you delete it?

5.What is the difference between a working directory, staging area, and repository?
Ongoing Task

6.Keep updating git-commands.md every day as you learn new Git commands in the upcoming days. This will become your personal Git reference. Maintain a clean commit history — one commit per update with a clear message.
